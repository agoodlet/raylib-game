TODO LIST:

- instead of taking in a position for each node on a component, just space the components equally based on amount of them
  - Do I want to allow for more granular control of this to design more interesting components?
- implement system for adding parts to the component
  - Battery
  - splitter
  - amplifier
- add resource system to component
  - component should have a certain amount of "power" units. Each output node and part would require a certain amount of power to be used
